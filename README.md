## Version Control
Version control is like a time machine for your projects. It keeps track of every change you make to your files, so you can always look back, undo mistakes, or see how your work has evolved over time. It also makes teamwork much smoother—everyone can work on the same project without stepping on each other’s toes, since the system keeps a record of who changed what and when. With version control, you can try out new ideas in separate branches, merge them when ready, and feel confident knowing your project’s history is safe and organized.
